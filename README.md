# 🛍️ Customer Behavior Analysis Dashboard integration

## 📖 Project Overview

This project dives into understanding how customers behave when they shop — specifically, what they **need** versus what they simply **want**. By analyzing sales data, we aim to break down purchasing patterns and find out how people spend their money across essential and non-essential products.

Knowing the difference between wants and needs helps businesses make smarter decisions in marketing, inventory planning, and customer engagement.

## ❓ What Problem Are We Solving?

Most businesses don’t have a clear picture of why customers buy what they do. Are they buying because they **need** it — or just because they **want** it?

The challenge here is:

* Figuring out which products are needs vs wants
* Understanding how different customers behave over time
* Helping businesses make data-backed decisions around these insights

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

* Tag each product as a **need** or **want**
* Analyze how different customers shop (who spends more on wants? who focuses on needs?)
* Track how these patterns change over time — like during holidays or tough economic periods
* Suggest ways businesses can act on these insights (e.g., marketing campaigns, product bundles)

---

## 🔍 How We Tackled It

### 1. **Data Preparation**

* Cleaned the sales data (fixed missing values, formatted dates, normalized prices)
* Grouped products based on their names/categories to tag them as **needs** or **wants**

  > (For example: Bread = need, Smartwatch = want)

### 2. **Exploratory Analysis (EDA)**

* Looked at total sales, top products, customer trends
* Compared how much is spent on wants vs needs across different customers, times, and locations

### 3. **Customer Segmentation**

* Used clustering to group customers by their buying habits

  > e.g., "Essential Buyers", "Impulse Spenders", etc.

### 4. **Behavior Tracking**

* Tracked changes in spending over time — like increases in want-based purchases during holidays
* Calculated useful metrics like:

  * **Wants-to-Needs Ratio**
  * **Average Cart Composition**
  * **Top Spending Customers**

## ⚠️ Challenges We Faced & How We Solved Them

| Issue                     | What We Did to Fix It                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| No labels for wants/needs | Manually tagged using product names + rules + domain logic |
| Messy product names       | Cleaned and standardized names using text processing       |
| Seasonal buying patterns  | Used time-based charts and analysis                        |
| Data imbalance            | Normalized values and used percentages for fair comparison |

## 📊 Key Insights

* Needs are bought consistently; wants spike during holidays and sales
* Some customers show high wants-to-needs spending ratios — good for luxury campaigns
* Essentials drive repeat purchases, while wants increase average basket value
* Younger buyers spend more on wants than older groups

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **Python** – pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Jupyter Notebook** – for development and analysis
* **(Optional)** Tableau / Power BI – for interactive dashboards

## 💡 What’s Next?

* Automate the classification using NLP (Natural Language Processing)
* Add external factors (like income or region) to improve accuracy
* Build a live dashboard for businesses to monitor trends in real-time
